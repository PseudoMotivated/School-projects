#Changes to the code from uppg2
Renamed the function names, from `RedBlinkFast()` and `RedBlinkSlow()` to a more general `DiodeBlinkFast()` and `DiodeBlinkSlow()`.
See the wiring schematics for more information about how I made the diodes blink simultaneously. 
Note: An alternate solution is available in uppg3b, where the goal is achieved through software instead. Its also more flexible though a little more sofisticated.

# Changes
Just used the same code from uppg4 and added a few lines to accomodate the yellow diode. I just copied the
code from the green diode and changed the variable names from green to yellow. And ofc i defined that yellow would have it own pin. 
I put that below the green diodes code so that the yellow diode would light up after the green diode and it would look neat.

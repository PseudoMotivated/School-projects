#Code
I know I didn't have to use the protothreads lib to make this but i just got bored, and protothreads makes the code more flexible
for adaptation and reuse later anyways. I could have accomplished the same thing using just the millis function and comparing it to recorded times
(as is done in the code) but I like this better. I just went way over the top with this. If you want to get to know how it works go read the comments ffs.

#Code
I think the comments in the code explain it well enough to be honest. 
I didn't change any existing code, i just wrote a new program because that would honestly be faster. 
What this thing does  is it just makes the red and green diodes blink after each other. 
It turns the green one on, then delay, then off and the red one gets turned on, then delay, then off. 
Simple.

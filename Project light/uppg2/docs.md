#Changes to code from assignment 1.
Duplicated the funtion that makes the red diode blink and renamed the two copies `RedBlinkFast()` and `RedBlinkSlow()` respectively. I edited the `delay()` in the functions to be `Delay(500)` in the fast function and `Delay(1000)` in the Slow one. Then i made `loop()` run the two funtions after each other.
